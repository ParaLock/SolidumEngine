# SolidumEngine

The SolidumEngine is an applications development platform designed for the agile business environment. NOTE: Although functional, this code is not production code. Its purpose is to show only a possible implementation of the Solidum spec.

The following is a simplified diagram of the Solidum architecture: **More detailed specification provided below diagram.**

# Architecture Overview

The SolidumEngine architecture is based on the following primary design considerations: 
1) Must resolve some of the primary limitations present in modern App Dev frameworks such as Qt5.
2) Must harness the power of a data driven paradigm (eg. Those present in game engines) to allow for the rapid, efficient and robust developement of all manner of generic applications.
3) Is built around a flexible and data oriented API which provides powerful features to the client whilst having the ability to mutate during runtime, based on the requirements of the API client.
